                <h4><u><b>COVID19 Student Vaccine Verification System - AI Based
                    CSVV:</b></u></h4>
                <p>
                     It is a website that supports school management to organize daily students’
                    entrance in smart and fast way to check if the students permitted to access school or not. 
                    it provides many good features to speed up their entrance process every morning. The 
                    system based on artificial intelligent (AI based) by using camera to scan student faces to 
                    get their identification, Immune check (Vaccine status) depend on “Tawakalna” database
                    and overall medical behavior through Skeleton Based Action Recognition. It also records
                    attendance in database and inform parents through notification in case the student absent.
                </p>

                <p>So, the CSVV project has many smart functions for student entrance procedure with less 
                time consumption. It requires only camera with laptop as hardware to provides functions 
                and features below:</p>
                 <ol>
                   <li> Student Identification through face recognin and Skelton based action recognition</li>
                   <li> Alert security personal to stop non-Immunized students depend on “Tawakalna” database</li>
                   <li> Skeleton based action recognition to support accuracy of face detection</li>
                   <li> Parent notification about status of student attendance. In case if student not permitted to access or not attended then system will inform parents through text message</li>
                   <li> Attendance recording and tracking for school administration</li>
                   <li>Multiple interfaces: one for school management as administration with full privileges and another interface for gate security personal janitor with less privileges</li>
                 </ol></br>

                <h4><u><b>Problem Description:</b></u></h4>
                <p>Students are back to school after COVID19 pandemic and their health is main concern to government, Education staff, families, and students themselves from virus affection especially when students wait in line at the gate every morning.
                Now the access permission must follow certain procedure with conditions:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Student must be Immune with at least two vaccine doses.</li>
                  <li>Student medical behavior are normal.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The main problem is how can education staff follow the new procedure in fast way with limited time and greater number of students without causes diseases infection? It is not possible if they follow traditional methods during queue check. And considered as hard task to do it every morning. So, we must find more efficient and effective way to develop new smart software or application that help to do the job in fast way, less time consumption, less error, with less resources.</p></br>
                  <hr>
                <h4><u><b>Project Scope:</b></u></h4>
                <p>CSVV is system with multiple interfaces that helps education staff to manage and organize student entrance queue to be as per certain medical conditions . It detects the student identification, authorize who takes vaccine doses and denied who didn’t take them, then record and tracking attendance for all student in daily basis to separate database. Finally send notification to student’s parent if he/she is not satisfied conditions.</p></br>
                  <hr>
                <h4><u><b>Project Objectives:</b></u></h4>
                <p>Main objective of CSVV project to ensure that no students allowed to access school without satisfy specific medical constrains as per decided by ministry of education to save students from COVID infection.
                To achieve that objective in fast and smart way we decided to develop this project to authorize the students who is following these constrains and denied who is not. Different methods and functions will be included to be helpful such as (Face recognition, skeleton based action) and additional features such as (Attendance tracking, notification message and diverse of interfaces with different authorization).</p>
